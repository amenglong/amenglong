👋 Hi, I’m Alvaro梦龙 from Barcelona based in Beijing

<br>

🌍 I'm the founder and CEO of Akkadu (https://rsi.akkadu.com) a Multilingual SDK helping virtual platforms:
- Stream content in multiple languages
- Host multilingual meetings

<br>

⚡With our `SDK` and `REST API` developers can seamlessly (within minutes, not hours) integrate into their applications:
1. Simultaneous Interpretation (SI) provided by professional interpreters
2. SI + AI Speech Recognition Subtitles
3. AI Speech Translation Subtitles

<br>

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on video/audio streaming projects that want to integrate our Multilingual SDK
